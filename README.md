# OS Simulator Project
Welcome to our OS Simulator! This repository is divided into parts that are designed to simulate various aspects of an operating system, providing a platform to study and analyse the functionality of key modules commonly found in modern operating systems.

Here you can see the modules implemented, basic details about them and also click on the specific sub-module to learn about it as well as simulate it.

## The simulator includes the following modules:

### Process Scheduling

This module simulates different process scheduling algorithms - FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Priority Scheduling, Round Robin and Multilevel Queue Scheduling.

### Process Synchronisation

In this module, you can simulate the 3 popular process synchronisation problems - Producer-Consumer problem, Readers-Writers problem and Dining Philosophers problem.

### Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's Algorithm has been implemented here to demonstrate deadlock detection in a multi-process environment.

### Memory Management

This module provides simulations for different algorithms that find out the available holes in the memory space and allocate them to the incoming processes - First Fit, Next Fit, Best Fit and Worst Fit.

### MFT/MVT

Explore memory allocation strategies in this module - Multiprogramming with Fixed Tasks (MFT) and Multiple Variable Tasks (MVT).

### Page Replacement

Study different page replacement algorithms - FIFO, OPR, LRU, MRU, MFU, Second Chance.

### Disk Scheduling

This module demonstrates various disk scheduling algorithms - FCFS, SSTF, Scan, C-Scan, Look and C-LOOK, to optimize disk access.

### File Allocation

Explore different file allocation methods - Contiguous allocation, Linked  allocation and indexed allocation, to understand how files are stored on disk.

### File Management

The file management module enables you to perform various file-related operations, such as create, delete, read, write, and modify files. There are 3 different file management systems - Single Level Directory, Two Level Directory and Hierarchical (Tree) Directory systems.

We have not included screenshots of simulation pages; what would be the fun then, right? So we want you to go out there and explore each and every bit of our OS simulator.
Happy simulating! ðŸš€
